# Developer Note

Note from the creator of Sylos: I am well aware the current version of DuckDB used in this project
is deprecated. If you are so bold as to try to modernize this stack, feel free, but the burden of 
proof is on you to prove your more modern dependency build of DuckDB works and all tests pass. 

If you are running windows, you will likely need to run the powershell script in this folder. 
Note that there are some hard coded paths in this script - please update them to your own corresponding
paths before running the script.
